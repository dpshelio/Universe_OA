    Let the Coding Begin! Chapter 2: Weeks 1 and 2 Dr. Erwan let us know about the community&rsquo;s plan to conduct our projects in teams of two, based on our projects&rsquo; similarities.
    Thus a team between Arunava Basu and I, and a team between Tran Huu Nhat Huy and Supriya Kumari was formed.
    Unfortunately, I fell sick midway through week 1. I tried to tackle smaller issues, but couldn&rsquo;t focus at all.
