    In week 3, I began testing my implementation of the chunksize feature. I found that there was an error being raised in the plotting of graphs, due to a library called publib being used. Upon searching for this library, I was amazed to see that it was built by Dr. Erwan! You can have a look at it here
    I initially thought nothing of the error, and was convinced that my implementation was correct.
