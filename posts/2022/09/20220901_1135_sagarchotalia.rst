    Chapter 0 Pre-GSoC Phase ??? - 20th May, 2022 I first started searching for organisations back in January. After extensive research, I found OpenAstronomy to be quite interesting and joined the Slack channel. I was looking at the sub-organisations in OpenAstronomy, and joined their individual Slack channels as well. It was around this time that I started looking at the issues of the sub-orgs. I was very new to open-source, hence even basic stuff like issuing PR&rsquo;s and tackling simple good-first-issues was challenging.
