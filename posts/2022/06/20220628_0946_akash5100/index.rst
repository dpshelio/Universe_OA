    <h3>GSoC 2022: Project Helioviewer — Starting my summer with SunPy</h3><p>Hey folks, this is my first blog about my work at Google Summer of Code 2022 (actually my first blog in general…)</p>
    <p>I will try to sum up how I got selected for the program (GSoC) and what I did in the first two weeks.</p>
    <p>I started contributing to open-source projects in September 2021, when I heard about the Google Summer of Code program from my friends, I had an eye for GSoC 2022.</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>Through the timeline, I knew that on the 7th of March Google will release the list of accepted organizations participating as mentors in 2022, I continued building my developer skills.</p>
    <p>On March 7th, I searched for organizations that matched my interest, i.e, science.</p>
    <p>When I saw <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/openastronomy"><strong>openAstronomy</strong></a><strong> </strong>at that moment I was like: <em>what the heck</em>? <em>astronomy and open source together? huehuehue</em></p>
    <p>I focused only on one project and while I prepared the proposal, I also made the following contributions:</p>
    <ul><li>In PR <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5980">#<strong>5980</strong></a> (code) and <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6024">#<strong>6024</strong></a> (updating docs), I wrote a test case for <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_ref/timeseries.html"><strong>sunpy.timeseries</strong></a>.</li><li>PR <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5961">#<strong>5961</strong></a> adds an example to show “how to reproject a map to a map projection with a custom origin”.</li></ul><p>In the one month before the results, to learn more about software testing and get familiar with <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/"><strong>pytest</strong></a>,<strong> </strong>I searched for issues labeled “Tests” in sunpy and <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6110">submitted this pull request</a>.</p>
    <p>On 22nd March, I received an email from Google which says:</p>
    <blockquote>Welcome to Google Summer of Code 2022!</blockquote><p>It was the most significant moment for me, for my family &amp; friends as well! This marked the start of the Community Bonding Period. <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/HXCZO14B">More details about my project.</a></p>
    <h3>The Community Bonding Period</h3><p>After getting selected for the program, I continued my contribution to sunpy. I worked on a python script that updates vendor code automatically in this <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6127">pull request</a>. I meet my mentor Nabil Freij, Jack Ireland and Daniel Garcia Briseno. In a meeting, I was introduced to my mentors and discussed a plan.</p>
    <h4><strong>The First and the Second Week</strong></h4><p>The coding period started, and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/21">designing the generic function</a> for the API wrapper. This PR is ready to merge and thanks to my amazing mentors, I have a clear idea of what I will do in the next two weeks. This is just the beginning, I will continue to post my GSoC work experience here.</p>
    <p>THIS IS EXHILARATING!</p>
