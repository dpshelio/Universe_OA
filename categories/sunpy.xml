This PR adds a function that accepts a URL Endpoint, Input Parameters (dictionary), and a descriptor of Output Parameters (what the endpoint is expected to return), which all the endpoint classes will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PR also includes the unittest for the Generic function and brings the first endpoint to the API wrapper, which is &lt;a href="https://hvpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/hvpy.parameters.getJP2ImageInputParameters.html#getjp2imageinputparameters"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getJP2Image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This endpoint retrieves a JP2000 image from the &lt;a href="http://helioviewer.org"&gt;helioviewer.org&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Week 4&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next task was to create a frontend for the &lt;strong&gt;getJP2Image &lt;/strong&gt;endpoint. The actual front end that users will interface with lives in a file called &lt;strong&gt;facade&lt;/strong&gt; which will hide this internal design. This module contains the API interface in its simplest form. It is responsible for taking user input, constructing the &lt;strong&gt;HvpyParameters &lt;/strong&gt;instance (the base class) and passing it to the &lt;strong&gt;core&lt;/strong&gt; to perform the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View the code in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/33"&gt;#33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Week 5&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, after the merging of the frontend function, we bring more JPEG2000 endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/34"&gt;#34&lt;/a&gt; — Adds the endpoint to the backend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/36"&gt;#36&lt;/a&gt; — Adds the frontend function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Week 6&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a problem left to solve. There are several mirrors for Helioviewer and people might want to use a mirror instead of the main URL. So we will need to add a way to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/41"&gt;#41&lt;/a&gt; closes this issue but it’s still under work. Hopefully, by the end of the week, it gets merged :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to sum up how I got selected for the program (GSoC) and what I did in the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started contributing to open-source projects in September 2021, when I heard about the Google Summer of Code program from my friends, I had an eye for GSoC 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the timeline, I knew that on the 7th of March Google will release the list of accepted organizations participating as mentors in 2022, I continued building my developer skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 7th, I searched for organizations that matched my interest, i.e, science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/openastronomy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openAstronomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at that moment I was like: &lt;em&gt;what the heck&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;astronomy and open source together? huehuehue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused only on one project and while I prepared the proposal, I also made the following contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5980"&gt;#&lt;strong&gt;5980&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (code) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6024"&gt;#&lt;strong&gt;6024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (updating docs), I wrote a test case for &lt;a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_ref/timeseries.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sunpy.timeseries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5961"&gt;#&lt;strong&gt;5961&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds an example to show “how to reproject a map to a map projection with a custom origin”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the one month before the results, to learn more about software testing and get familiar with &lt;a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pytest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I searched for issues labeled “Tests” in sunpy and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6110"&gt;submitted this pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 22nd March, I received an email from Google which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome to Google Summer of Code 2022!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the most significant moment for me, for my family &amp;amp; friends as well! This marked the start of the Community Bonding Period. &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/HXCZO14B"&gt;More details about my project.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Community Bonding Period&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting selected for the program, I continued my contribution to sunpy. I worked on a python script that updates vendor code automatically in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/6127"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;. I meet my mentor Nabil Freij, Jack Ireland and Daniel Garcia Briseno. In a meeting, I was introduced to my mentors and discussed a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First and the Second Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coding period started, and I worked on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/pull/21"&gt;designing the generic function&lt;/a&gt; for the API wrapper. This PR is ready to merge and thanks to my amazing mentors, I have a clear idea of what I will do in the next two weeks. This is just the beginning, I will continue to post my GSoC work experience here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS EXHILARATING!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been contributing to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube"&gt;ndcube&lt;/a&gt; - a &lt;a href="https://sunpy.org/"&gt;sunpy&lt;/a&gt; affiliated package, which is itself a part of the umbrella organization called &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;openastronomy&lt;/a&gt;. Phew, that’s quite some hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of pull requests that I’ve opened during the coding period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/433"&gt;Initial implementation for validating two WCS&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Merged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Implements a function to check if two given WCS objects are compatible with each other for reprojecting the NDCube.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/434"&gt;Reproject implementation&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Merged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adds a method to reproject an NDCube using the astropy package called reproject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/439"&gt;Reproject NDCube Documentation&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Merged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Documentation for the above PR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/436"&gt;Combine cubes from NDCubeSequence using reproject&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Unmerged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stacks the data of all cubes in an NDCubeSequence together into one cube.

I’d have never imagined working with SunPy as a GSoC student and here I am concluding it with the final report. Before I summarize all the 30+ pull requests I’ve made to Sunkit-Pyvista, I just want to take a moment to than the brilliant mentors I’ve gotten to work with. The were not only patient and understanding but also extremely helpful with making me understand how everything works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*SExFSpEK386SN8OQ_fOtEQ.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to Sunpy, or should I say Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunkit-Pyvista was created with the intention of extending Sunpy’s extensive plotting capabilities to 3D with the help of a VTK wrapper for Python — Pyvista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with either of these libraries were extremely short-lived, but over the summer I got my hands dirty with them and loved every bit of it. I would’ve never imagined me doing a project regarding astronomy or 3D plotting, but here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original idea was proposed by one of the mentors a while and after an entire summer of working on it, I’m proud to say that I was a part of this library’s initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire project was planned out over the 10 weeks of the GSoC period and I’m pretty proud to say that we had gotten done with everything slightly ahead of time which left us a few buffer weeks for us to review code and catch some bugs. For now, majority of the plotting/visualization functionality from Sunpy has been added to Sunkit-Pyvista, and we do have plans for some pretty cool stuff later on! I’m excited to see how this project would be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s a list of all the significant PRs I’ve made to the library which were carefully reviewed by both my mentors before any merges happened. The entire list of all my PRs can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Every PR came with it’s own change-log and was carefully documented throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/4"&gt;Initial setup of the code written by one of the mentors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/10"&gt;Ability to set camera coordinates functionality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/12"&gt;Addition of Pfsspy field lines visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/17"&gt;Drawing_Quadrangle on a 3D map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/23"&gt;Unit test time!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/24"&gt;Efficient Plotting with MultiBlocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/26"&gt;Clip Interval for clipping of data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/29"&gt;Functionality to Plot tiny sphere at a given coordinate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/30"&gt;Adding in some examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jeffrey-paul2000.medium.com/feed#34"&gt;Ah, bug-fixes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/37"&gt;Saving and loading plots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/38"&gt;Figure tests are now a thing!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/52"&gt;Performance enhancements to draw_quadrangle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/55"&gt;Plot_limb from Sunpy, but in 3D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/73"&gt;Color enhancements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from these PRs, a lot more smaller ones were made which were related these significant ones in terms of enhancements or bug-fixes, but for the most part, everything is covered here. I think we’re set to have our 0.1 release right after the mentors take care of how the documentation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also planned to work on some cool &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/57"&gt;animations&lt;/a&gt; using the Pyvistaqt module but this was out of the scope of the original GSoC project so we’ve put a pin in it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my work doesn’t stop here. Being one of the main developers of this project, I’d love to continue working and building on it. Here’s to the amazing folks at SunPy and GSoC for this opportunity. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=87f74dd364df" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210819_0250_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 01:50:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>About my Google Summer of Code Project: Part 4</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210817_0956_adwaitbhope/</link><dc:creator>Adwait Bhope</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The last few days haven’t been as productive as earlier. We fixed some issues with the NDCubeSequence’s stacking PR and it looks like it’s ready to merge now. With some feedback from the community, I think it will happen soon. There have also been some minor updates to the PR that brings reproject’s other algorithms to NDCube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new task that I’ve taken up now is identifying invariant axes in a cube. Let’s say there’s a 3D data cube where one of the axes corresponds to a quantity like time, which you don’t want to reproject onto another grid. Identifying this axis would let us reproject at only one point along this axis and then apply it throughout. This will speed up the execution significantly and require a lesser amount of memory. It’s a tricky path though and the first implementation might not be very efficient. What we’re trying to do is convert pixel coordinates to world coordinates using the source WCS, and convert it back from world to pixel using the target WCS. If the original and final pixel coordinates match, we can conclude that the axis is invariant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall update its progress soon, but this is all for now. GSoC is officially coming to an end, but as I said in the previous post, it doesn’t matter much for continuing my contributions to this community. I’ve been fascinated by this open-source environment and culture and learned so much along the way. I guess GSoC did serve its purpose for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some work at sunraster, specifically updating it to work with ndcube 2.0 (whose RC1 was released recently). That sounds like a fun project given that I’m now familiar with ndcube. In fact, that was a project I had considered applying for as part of GSoC but hadn’t. I’ll let you all know how that goes. Cheers for now, I’ll talk to you in the next one!&lt;/p&gt;

OpenAstronomy has helped me improve the way I express myself in a satirical manner. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what’s the plan for my future but let’s save that story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y0Rim-lsXAAtQbRuk6-37A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Here’s picture of sun and its field lines to show that I’m working on astronomy related, but actually have no proper knowledge of how any of this works, cheers! 🍻&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit of how my last week of “officially” working on Sunkit-Pyvista went :-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We put a pin on the animator as it didn’t make sense for us to work on something that isn’t of more value for the first release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pfsspy field lines now allow for a custom color function to be passed while plotting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All main functionality is big-free (as far as I know) and can be used efficiently without having to worry about something failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final boss with our little project is trying to get the documentation to render 3D plots correctly and this is being handled by the mentors which is a huge load off my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it I guess, these last few PRs mark the end of the so called “GSoC” period. What more have I left out? I’ve spoken about everything there is to be said, we’re nearing the end of this pretty interesting journey that I had embarked on. Other than a small bit of sadness, I’ve got nothing else to say. I’ve decided to continue working on Sunkit-Pyvista as being an open-sourced contributor is all about the community and I’m doing my part in working towards that (It’s not like I was planning on leaving either way though, this is almost a part of my daily routine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to Sunpy and the best mentors I’ve interacted with. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

It defines a base-level functionality or MVP if you want to call it that, along with some relevant documentation. We also mark the release of ndcube’s 2.0 RC1. This is an important milestone since ndcube 2.0 brings significant changes, owing to the implementation of the new high-level WCS API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next plan of action was to extend the method to use other algorithms that reproject supports. Interpolation (the one that the above PR implements) supports multi-dimensional cubes but “adaptive” and “exact” algorithms do not. For the time being, they only work on 2D cubes containing celestial axes. So that’s what I’ve implemented them for in a new PR, which is currently under review and should hopefully get merged soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem for this PR was identifying celestial axes. We’ve taken a shortcut to solve this quickly and avoid creating a blocker, but a better implementation is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NDCubeSequence PR that I talked about in the last blog post hit a few unexpected edge cases which are under work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re nearing the end of GSoC’s official timeline and while that is saddening, the good thing is that open source doesn’t need a GSoC timeline for contributing. I do hope that I’ll be able to tie up any loose ends before the end date, but I suppose that does not matter in the community’s bigger picture. Functional additions, bug fixes, and performance improvements are always going to be coming in for reproject, and I plan to maintain at least that bit of code (or more) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Although, outer space looks all fancy and it goes well with the theme of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From all my previous posts, it is quite evident that I obsess over small and insignificant details, mainly directed towards how my life is going to be in the future and this entire concept of “happiness”. However, the past few months of working with Sunpy has brought about this odd sense of calm. The entire feeling of stress being an emotion goes out the window. Maybe this is what doing something you love, maybe it’s the people — or maybe it’s just extremely good timing combined with coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I suppose these questions don’t have simple answers. Regardless, whatever I’m doing with right now has restored that balance that I was longing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to what has been happening with sunkit-pyvista. To summarize, I spent an entire week fixing things that I caused due to over-confidence :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I think I’m nearing the end of this project. A few bits of functionality has to be added in but for the most part, I think it’s all in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saving and loading entire scenes are now possible with the work that we’ve done. This took quite a bit of time and it was pretty interesting to see how we could extend functionality to such massive extents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We uncovered a few hidden issues that may have occurred because of me. Ones such as ill-defined tests because I may have been slightly over-confident with how I write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a bit of time was spent resolving these issues, but I can definitely conclude that it was well worth the effort and I certainly learnt my lesson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure tests are now a thing, we drew some parallels with Pyvista’s code and structured our own figure testing methodology which makes it easier for us to visually identify any mishaps in our plots. After all, we’re creating a library for data visualization. It’d be sad if our code tests pass and we’re under the assumption that everything is working fine (yet another dig at myself for not writing efficient tests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can safely say that Sunkit-Pyvista is quite balanced and usable now, or at least I hope so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to how this might be the last few PRs of this project under the whole “GSoC timeline”, this makes me both sad and happy. It’s saddening to see that something I worked towards for over 6 months has kind of come to an end. Happy because I’ve gotten to work with some of the best developers and I genuinely enjoyed every bit of it. This offsets the balance in my life, but I think we may have a solution to this?&lt;/p&gt;

I talked about what my project was in the &lt;a href="https://adwaitbhope.medium.com/about-my-google-summer-of-code-project-part-1-b56e7277046e"&gt;last blog&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll use this one to cover the progress we’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work so far has been compiled into 3 messy PRs. To start with, reprojecting an NDCube onto another WCS requires that you first validate whether the source and target WCS transformations are in fact compatible. It’s no good if they represent an entirely different coordinate system. They need to have the same number of world axes and in the same order. The first PR introduces a function to check this and it has been merged into the main branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one implements the actual reproject method on NDCube, leveraging the reproject package. Currently, it serves as a wrapper around the interpolation algorithm, with plans to support more algorithms soon. But that bit is dependent on optimizing the current functionality by being a little smarter about detecting axes that do not need to be modified. This would also help speed up the function AND use less memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third PR is an interesting one. There is a class called NDCubeSequence, which is, as the name says, a sequence of NDCubes. Think of it as multiple NDCubes arranged in an array with some additional convenient functionality. Let’s say you have some information about an image that isn’t really related to any of the axes but applies to the whole image — the timestamp of the image, for example. If you have multiple similar images taken at different timestamps, they can form an NDCubeSequence, where the sequence axis represents time. You can also combine the sequence axis with an existing axis of the cubes so that they form a large panorama or mosaic, which is wider than the field of view that could’ve been captured in one image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the individual cubes do not share the same WCS object even if they are images of the same entity. This is because of effects like wobble or rotation that introduce slight changes in the WCS. So we used the previously implemented reproject method to get all the cubes on the same grid, so they can share the WCS. Then, we stacked the data of all cubes together in one single numpy array, introducing an extra dimension that corresponds to the sequence. A new WCS is also constructed that includes this newly formed dimension. You combine this data and the WCS, and voila, you have reduced the NDCubeSequence to an NDCube!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps would be to refine this behaviour and try to optimize wherever possible. Then we’ll try to get these 2 remaining PRs merged in the main branch to avoid getting inundated later. So, this is all for this post, see you in the next one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=2e6f76a45653" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210711_1548_adwaitbhope/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 14:48:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Not just Python.</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210710_1254_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;h4&gt;Not just Python&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunkit-Pyvista is doing quite well as of today, this goes without saying due to the fact the the Sunpy developers put in quite a bit of effort into reading all the stuff that I write and they do carefully review them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve personally faced no a few issues with getting things to work as they are. I don’t have much to say about this project except the fact that I’m super stoked about it and it has been going super well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to write code from scratch that’s turned into an actual project that would help someone, I also get to learn stuff that I never saw myself doing. From tinkering around with CircleCI to getting documentation to work the way we want them to, this project seems like the ideal one for a python developer like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize what happened over the past few weeks —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve gotten over most of the project and we’re now working towards the initial stuff we put a pin in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic plotting functionality of Sunpy now exists with Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We moved the documentation over to GitHub workflows and I’m hoping that we get it to work by the end of the month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve introduced animations as a new feature to our work and we’ve got some ideas with how to take this forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having no prior experience with Astrophysics, I decided to give Stephen Hawking’s “The Theory of Everything” a read. (Well, not a read, I prefer listening to audio books even though they are inferior). Revisiting physics with an astronomical sense gave me such a new perspective on what I am doing and fueled the motivation to continue the project with the same excitement I began with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zrsJJIzLw4FexpUa1-SAUw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regardless of it not actually looking like this — it still is fascinating, isn’t it?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I never saw myself voluntarily taking an interest in astrophysics or open source software, but here I am today, doing both of them simultaneously. Who knows what the future holds for me, I’ve always been anxious about that. At times like these I try to think of how this universe is so nondeterministic, we may have a few guesses and theories as to why things happen the way it does but, we can’t say for sure. This thought grounds my thoughts and I suddenly stop worrying about everything, for sometime at-least…&lt;/p&gt;
